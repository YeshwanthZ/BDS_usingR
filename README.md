# BiomedicalDataScience 
I completed two projects using R Programming as a requirement for my Masters degree in Biomedical Data Science. These projects covered a wide range of statistical concepts, such as Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Data Analytics, Statistical Modelling, Model Evaluation, Hypothesis Testing, Correlation, Measures of Central Tendency, Measures of Dispersion, Sampling Methods, and Confidence Intervals. They also involved various R Programming fundamentals, including Conditional Statements, Loop Optimization, Dataframes, Data Tables, Plots, Matrices, and packages such as Base, Stats, pROC, ggplot2, glmnet, among others.
