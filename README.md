# RProgrammingportfolio
I have put together a collection of very interesting projects using R Programming that I had 
submitted during my Masters degree. These projects cover a major portion of Statistics concepts 
such as Data Analysis, Data Visualisation, Data Analytics, Statistical modelling, Model testing 
Model Evaluation, Hypothesis testing, Correlation, Measures of Central tendency, Measures of 
Dispersion, Sampling methods, Maximum Likelihood Estimate, Newton's Method, Splines, Confidence 
intervals etc. They also cover various R Programming fundamentals and packages such as rjags, 
ggplot2, glmnet, splines etc.
